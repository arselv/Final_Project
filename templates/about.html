    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>As the wealth management division of Stratton Oakmont, Leonardo DiCaprio himself has tasked us in predicting which stock will grow or sink in the coming months.  We would like to predict stock prices using machine learning algorithms and the ability to switch between stock ticker symbols.</p>
    <img src="static/images/LSTM-diagram.png" alt="LSTM diagram">
    <p>Our stock prediction model is using a recurrent neural network architecture known as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).  LSTM networks work well with time series data such as stocks because they can carry and process important information over long periods of time and allows the layers to continue learning and providing input to the neural network.  The cells in the LSTM network take historical and current information as well as the previous cell state to decide what the output and what to pass along to the next cell.</p>
    <h1>Deep Dive/Infrastructure Walkthrough</h1>
    <p>We used the python library yfinance to download historical stock market data from Yahoo finance.  Five years of closing data was gathered for each stock.  We created individual models for Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Tesla that were trained on the first four years of data over 50 epochs in batch sizes of 32 closing stock prices and tested it against the fifth year. We combined the data into a dataframe that was then converted to JSON.  Our web page contains a dropdown for the user to select the stock for prediction.  The selection of the stock will retrieve the stock data and run it through the model and returns the output as a JSON which is then gathered using d3 from our api and plotted using Plotly.</p>
    <h1>Difficulties</h1>
    <p>Getting the right number of epoch cycles for training the model.  We tried training with less epochs, predicted values were very off. </p>
    <p>We also tried creating a model based on the combination of all five stock closing values that could be used for a market trend. </p>
